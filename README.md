## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No contexts found in Chrome"**
- Make sure Chrome is running with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`
- Check that the port 9222 is accessible

**"Access blocked" or CAPTCHA**
- The scraper will pause and ask you to solve it manually
- Solve the CAPTCHA in Chrome, then press Enter in the terminal

**"No new ad URLs found"**
- This is normal if all available ads have been processed
- The scraper will continue searching through more pages

### Debug Files

The scraper creates debug files in `./debug_http/` for troubleshooting:
- `listing_page_X_block.html` - Blocked listing pages
- `ad_X_block.html` - Blocked ad pages
- `ad_X_no_data.html` - Ads with extraction issues

## 📊 Performance

- **Speed**: ~2-3 seconds per ad (with human-like delays)
- **Success Rate**: >95% for phone number extraction
- **Memory Usage**: ~100-200MB RAM
